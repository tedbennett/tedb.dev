description: Starting a new personal website with Hugo
---

## Welcome to my new site!

I'm building this site to showcase my personal projects, and to provide a place for me to talk about problems and interesting things I find while working. I'm going to try to keep a blog of fleshed-out project ideas I have, worked leetcode solutions, handy code snippets and just general things I find interesting.

I'm building it with Hugo, and creating a custom theme with Bulma.

My previous website ([here](https://github.com/tedbennett/old-tedb.dev)) was built with React and Firebase. While it was loads of fun to create and I learnt a lot building it, it became clear it was the wrong tool for the job. Hugo will allow me to build and update a site much more easily and quickly.
