Kude allows you to share your Spotify session with your friends so that they can

### Description

This app allows a user with Spotify Premium to create a session and invite others to join the session. The session members can then add songs to the music queue on the session host's device.

Built using SwiftUI and Firebase, this app interacts with the Spotify API via Cloud Functions.

This app will be expanded soon to allow users to also use the Apple Music streaming service too, which allows for more interactions with music queue.
