My personal website, you're here now!

### Description

This website is built with Hugo, and the layouts designed with Tailwind CSS. I wanted to create a place where I can display my portfolio, and also write about my progress and anything interesting I find whilst building things.

My previous website ([here](https://github.com/tedbennett/old-tedb.dev)) was built with React, Bootstrap and Firebase. This was a great learning experience, but the result wasn't all that great, and I much prefer this version.
