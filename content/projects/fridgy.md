Fridgy is an app to help you manage your fridge and shopping lists, available on the App Store.

### Description

This is a redesign of the first app I submitted to the App Store. It's much simpler and easier to use than it's previous version, and one I can actually see myself using regularly. The app features custom categories the user can create to organise the food in their fridge. The user can create a shopping lists, which automatically add items to the fridge when they are checked off.

### Future Work

I'm currently working on a backend (or perhaps CloudKit) to allow syncing of a fridge between multiple users, for use by people living in shared households.
