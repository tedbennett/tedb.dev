A simple web app to visualise a reddit post's awards.

### Description

This website unpacks a reddit post's json body and lists it's awards. It also gives info about how much premium the post's author received and how much money users collectively might have spent on the post (this is inaccurate, since a lot of coins are given away by reddit for free). The web app is built with React and React-Bootstrap, with an Express backend and hosted on Heroku.

I haven't got round to adding ping my dyno yet so it may take a few seconds to spin up!
